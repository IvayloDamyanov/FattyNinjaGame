# FattyNinjaGame
Game for the course JavaScript UI &amp; DOM. Team "Eos".


## Description
Our hero - **'Fatty ninja'**, is really greedy and all that he wants is collecting more and more score points. There are two ways
of reaching his only goal: 
- Jumping over the boxes - this way he gets 10 score points
- Breaking the boxes with his sword - this way he adds 30 points to his score points.
  - *It's not difficult to estimate which one prefers our ninja.
